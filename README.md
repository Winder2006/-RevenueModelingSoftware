# 💰 Fintech Financial Model

A comprehensive financial modeling software for fintech platforms with RIA-based, treasury, and lending functions. This dynamic, scalable model allows users to run different scenarios, including ideal future state, base case, and downside risk cases.

## 🚀 Features

### Revenue Streams Modeled
- **AUA-based fees** (basis points on assets under administration)
- **Transaction fees** (per transaction fee on lending or fund movement)
- **Interest spread/fee on internal lending** (percent of loan spread or flat fee)
- **SaaS monthly fees** (optional - can be toggled on/off)
- **Fund-side revenue share** (bps from banking/fund partner)

### Cost Structure
- **Fixed operating costs** (platform development, legal, compliance, staff, overhead)
- **Variable costs** tied to volume (per client, per loan, per $1MM AUA)
- **Customizable cost categories**

### Key Capabilities
- **Dynamic scenario analysis** (base case, downside, upside)
- **Monte Carlo simulations** for risk assessment
- **Sensitivity analysis** on key variables
- **Interactive dashboards** with real-time calculations
- **Breakeven analysis** with multiple time horizons
- **Cash flow projections** and runway calculations

## 📊 Model Inputs

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the application** using `streamlit run app.py`
2. **Adjust assumptions** in the sidebar:
   - Start with the default assumptions
   - Modify values based on your business model
   - Toggle revenue streams on/off as needed

### Key Sections

#### 📊 Dashboard
- **Current Revenue**: Monthly revenue projection

- **Breakeven**: Month and AUA needed to breakeven
- **Cash Flow**: Cumulative cash position

#### 📈 Charts
- **Cash Burn Curve**: Shows cumulative cash flow over time
- **Revenue vs Costs**: Monthly comparison
- **Revenue Mix**: Breakdown by revenue stream
- **AUA Growth**: Assets under administration growth

#### 📊 Monthly Data
- Detailed monthly projections table
- All key metrics by month
- Exportable data for further analysis

#### 🔄 Scenarios
- **Base Case**: Your current assumptions
- **Downside**: Conservative scenario (adjustable multiplier)
- **Upside**: Optimistic scenario (adjustable multiplier)
- Side-by-side comparison of key metrics

#### 🎲 Monte Carlo
- **Run simulations** with variable inputs
- **Probability distributions** for key outcomes
- **Survival probability** analysis
- **Risk assessment** for different scenarios

#### 📊 Sensitivity Analysis
- **Variable selection**: Choose which parameter to analyze
- **Impact visualization**: See how changes affect breakeven
- **Optimization insights**: Find optimal fee structures

### Best Practices

1. **Start with realistic assumptions**
   - Use industry benchmarks for fee structures
   - Consider your target market size
   - Factor in competitive pressures

2. **Test multiple scenarios**
   - Always run downside scenarios
   - Consider regulatory changes
   - Test different growth rates

3. **Use Monte Carlo for risk assessment**
   - Run at least 1000 simulations
   - Focus on survival probability
   - Analyze breakeven distributions

4. **Iterate and refine**
   - Adjust assumptions based on results
   - Test different revenue mix combinations
   - Optimize for your target breakeven timeline

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Revenue Streams
1. Modify the `FinancialModel` class in `financial_model.py`
2. Add calculation methods for new revenue types
3. Update the sidebar inputs in `app.py`
4. Include new streams in total revenue calculations

### Modifying Cost Structure
1. Add new cost categories in the model
2. Update variable cost calculations
3. Add corresponding sidebar inputs
4. Include in total cost calculations

### Extending Analysis Period
1. Change the `months` parameter in `FinancialModel.__init__()`
2. Adjust chart timeframes accordingly
3. Update Monte Carlo simulation periods

## 📋 Example Use Cases

### RIA Platform
- **AUA fees**: 25-50 basis points
- **Transaction fees**: $5-25 per transaction
- **SaaS fees**: $200-1000 per month
- **Focus**: Client retention and AUA growth

### Lending Platform
- **Lending fees**: 100-300 basis points
- **Transaction fees**: $10-50 per transaction
- **AUA fees**: 10-25 basis points
- **Focus**: Loan volume and credit quality

### Hybrid Platform
- **Combined revenue streams**: AUA + lending + SaaS
- **Diversified risk**: Multiple income sources
- **Scalable model**: Leverage technology for efficiency

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Model Limitations
- **Assumptions**: All projections are based on input assumptions
- **Market conditions**: Model doesn't account for market volatility
- **Regulatory changes**: Future regulatory impacts not included
- **Competition**: Competitive dynamics not explicitly modeled

### Risk Considerations
- **Cash flow**: Monitor runway and breakeven timelines
- **Growth assumptions**: Be conservative with growth projections
- **Fee sensitivity**: Test impact of fee changes on viability
- **Cost escalation**: Factor in potential cost increases

### Validation
- **Cross-check**: Compare with industry benchmarks
- **Sensitivity**: Test key assumptions thoroughly
- **Scenarios**: Always run multiple scenarios
- **Expert review**: Have financial experts review outputs
